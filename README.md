🎹 Piano — Play Loud, Debug Later 🎵🔥

A fun, interactive JavaScript Piano built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS — no frameworks!
Click or press your keyboard keys (A–L, E–P) to play sounds in real time.
It even supports holding keys and multiple sounds at once for that true chaotic musician energy 😎.


✨ Features

🎧 Play piano using mouse or keyboard

🖱️ Click, Hold, and Release — responsive key animations

🎨 SVG-based piano design

🔊 Real-time audio playback

⚙️ Pure JavaScript (no libraries or frameworks)

💥 Animated background & key press effects



🧠 How It Works

Each key (A–L, E–P) corresponds to an audio file in the /sounds folder.
Pressing or clicking a key triggers a sound via the Web Audio API — allowing multiple notes at once.
